<h2 id="qos">Ocelotds minimizes server calls</h2>
<p>When a specicific call is in progress, if the same, exactly the same, service is call before the result of previous call.<br>
	Ocelotds detect that and will not request again the server.<br>
	So ocelotds minimizes the loading of server.
</p>
<p>With this feature, don't worry about disable/enable buttons. If the user clicks on many times, the server will be call one time.</p>
<p>Of course this feature combines with feature cache.</p>

<h3>what's determined calls are similar</h3>
<p>Ocelotds consideres that 2 services is identic if the class, the method and arguments are identic.</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">service.getValue(5, "foo", {"id":5,"name":"foo"}).then(handler1) 
 == 
service.getValue(5, "foo", {"id":5,"name":"foo"}).then(handler2)</code></pre>
<pre><code class="javascript">service.getValue(5, "foo", {"id":5,"name":"foo"}).then(handler1)
 != 
service.getValue(1, "foo", {"id":5,"name":"foo"}).then(handler2)</code></pre>
<h4>Note, the calls signature is based on cache key</h4>
<p>If the result have to put in cache, the mecanisms for determine that 2 calls are identic is based on the class, the method name and keys declared on java service.</p>
<pre><code class="java">package test;
@DataService(resolver = ...)
public class TestService {
  @JsCacheResult(minute=2, keys={"a.id"})
  public Result methodCached(A a, B b, Collection&lt;C&gt; cs) {
     // the result of this methode will be cached on the client for 2 minute.
     // The key entry is the footprint of test.TestService.methodCached(a.getId())
     // for each differents values of a.id (a.getId()) we have different cache
     ...
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>In this case : </p>
<pre><code class="javascript">testService.methodCached({"id":5,"name":"x"}, {"a":"y","b":"z"}, []).then(handler1)
 == 
testService.methodCached({"id":5,"name":"y"}, null, []).then(handler2)</code></pre>
